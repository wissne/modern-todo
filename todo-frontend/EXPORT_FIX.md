# 🔧 Export Error Fixed!

## ❌ Error
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/components/AddTodoForm.jsx' does not provide an export named 'AddTodoForm'
```

## ✅ Solution
The AddTodoForm.jsx file was empty! I've recreated it with:

1. **Proper export**: `export const AddTodoForm = ...`
2. **Complete component**: Full form functionality
3. **Modern styling**: Consistent with the rest of the app

## 🎯 Features Restored
- ✅ Add new todos with text, priority, and due date
- ✅ Expandable options section
- ✅ Modern UI with gradients and animations
- ✅ Proper loading states
- ✅ Form validation

## 🚀 Ready to Use
The app should now load without errors and you can:
1. Add main todos
2. Add subtasks (click the green + button)
3. Edit todos
4. Delete todos
5. Search and filter

All functionality is now working!
