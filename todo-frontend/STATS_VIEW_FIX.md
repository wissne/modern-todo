# 📊 Statistics View Enhancement

## ✅ Improvement
Progress information and statistics now only display when the "Statistics" navigation item is selected.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Conditional Statistics Display
- **Before**: Stats showed on all views when todos existed
- **After**: Stats only show when "Statistics" is selected in navigation
- **Clean Views**: Other views now focus purely on todo management

### 2. Hidden Elements in Stats View
When "Statistics" is selected, the following are hidden:
- ❌ Add Todo Form
- ❌ Search Bar  
- ❌ Todo List
- ❌ Empty State Messages

### 3. Dedicated Statistics Experience
- **Focus**: Pure analytics and insights view
- **Clean**: No distracting todo management UI
- **Comprehensive**: Full statistics dashboard

## 🎯 Benefits

### 1. Better UX
- **Focused Views**: Each view has a clear purpose
- **Less Clutter**: Todo views are cleaner without stats
- **Dedicated Analytics**: Statistics get full attention

### 2. Logical Navigation
- **Active Tasks**: Shows only active todos
- **All Tasks**: Shows all todos
- **Completed**: Shows completed todos
- **Statistics**: Shows only analytics and progress

### 3. Performance
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only renders needed components
- **Faster Loading**: Less DOM elements in each view
- **Optimized**: Better resource usage

4. **Easy Switching**: One click to toggle views
