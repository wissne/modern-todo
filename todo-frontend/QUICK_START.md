## Fixed: Page Refresh Issue

The infinite refresh issue has been resolved! The problem was caused by:

1. **SearchBar useEffect** - Had `onSearch` in dependencies causing infinite re-renders
2. **Missing useCallback** - Functions were recreated on every render

## ✅ Fixes Applied

1. **SearchBar.jsx** - Removed `onSearch` from useEffect dependencies
2. **App.jsx** - Added `useCallback` to `handleSearch` function  
3. **useTodos.js** - Added `useCallback` to `fetchTodos` and `searchTodos`

## 🎯 Start the Application

## 🐛 Issue Resolution

**Problem**: Page kept refreshing todo items continuously

**Root Cause**: 
- SearchBar's useEffect included `onSearch` function in dependencies
- `onSearch` function was recreated on every App component render
- This caused infinite useEffect triggers

**Solution**:
- Removed `onSearch` from useEffect dependencies in SearchBar
- Added `useCallback` to memoize functions in App and useTodos hook
- Now search works smoothly with 300ms debouncing

The app should now work perfectly without any refresh issues!
